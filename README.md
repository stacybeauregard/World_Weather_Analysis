# World_Weather_Analysis

## Challenge 6 is helping with the PlanMyTrip app. Testers have asked that weather data and descriptions be added to their filters so they can identify vacation locations based upon temperature preferences. 

This challenge has added four cities to create an itinerary based upon the temperature preferences and creates a driving itinerary for the vacationer.

The marker layer on the maps has added current weather information for the cities they are traveling to.
